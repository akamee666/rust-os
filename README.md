## Simple OS written for fun.

I've found this channel on Youtube [sphaerophoria-channel](https://youtube.com/@sphaerophoria ) with a lot of interesting stuff and decide to follow him creating an OS in rust. Most of the code here were sphaerophoria as source, also getting some good ideas in this blog [os-phill-blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/vga-text-mode/).
